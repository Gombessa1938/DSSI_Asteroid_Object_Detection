DSSI 2021 summer project <br>

**project 1: start galaxy classification task**<br>

for this task we were given 50,000 images of star or galaxy crop images from astronomy data, each object has 8 channels data which are g band, r band, i band, z band, and their point spread function in each band. <br>

the filter data are standard Sloan digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric filters, the g band and r band are considered visual spectrum, where i band and z band are in the near infrared spectrum.<br>
